# Log

## ssh

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
alias sshlab='ssh -p 9999 yzy@localhost' // localhost=127.0.0.1
```

## startup.conf

```
# ~/Projects/vpp/startup.conf
# Default configuration file
unix { interactive cli-listen /run/vpp/cli-vpp1.sock gid 1000 }
```

```
# ~/Projects/vpp/startup-vpp2.conf
# Open another socke
unix { interactive cli-listen /run/vpp/cli-vpp2.sock }
```

Run with configuration:

```bash
$ make START_CONF=<config_file> run
```

Alias was added for default `make run`:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc
$ alias vppmrc='make STARTUP_CONF="startup.conf" run'
```

## Baby Testbed

This is the baby testbed that I'm about to build in the early stage, for getting more familiar with VPP API. This baby testbed consiss of a three namespace and one vpp instance, which has load-balancer plug-in embedded. Namespace 1 and 2 shares the same VIP while have different PIP.

## Multi-thread VPP

Multi-thread is not necessary for this intern.

## Segment Routing

SR is not necessary for this intern. But it would be interesting to implement [6LB](http://www.thomasclausen.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2018-IEEE-Transactions-on-Networking-6LB-Scalable-and-Application-Aware-Load-Balancing-with-Segment-Routing.pdf) either as the testbed of as a VPP plug-in per se, if time allows.

## Progressive VPP Tutorial

Following [this tutorial](https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/Progressive_VPP_Tutorial#Exercise:_Create_an_Interface), I'm trying to get myself more familiar with VPP.

Just as a reminder, in order to try the communication between two VPP instances, I temporarily disabled the `dpdk` plug-in in order to open two VPP instances at the same time.

```bash
# Temporarily move dpdk_plugin.so to .../vpp/dpdk_plugin_backup.so
~/Projects/vpp$ mv /home/yzy/Projects/vpp/build-root/install-vpp_debug-native/vpp/lib64/vpp_plugins/dpdk_plugin.so dpdk_plugin_backup.so
```

## Lenovo P51s

Ordered a workstation P51s which has an impressive GPU **NVIDIA Quadro M520** that can do good for training ML models later. I'm looking forward to configure the WSL.
