# About

I am a first year PhD student in Computer Networking, pursuing jointly between [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en)'s [networking team](https://www.epizeuxis.net) and Cisco Systems Paris Innovation and Research Lab (PIRL), advised by [Thomas Clausen](https://www.thomasclausen.net/en/) and [Mark Townsley](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=RSW64hsAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao). My research interests include data-center networks, load-balancing, high-performance networking stacks, machine learning, and their applications in computer networking. 

Before starting my PhD, I obtained an MSc in [Internet-of-Things](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/master-all-msct-programs/internet-of-things-innovation-and-management-master/internet-of-things) from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) in 2019, and a BEng in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics from [Harbin Institut of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn) in 2017.
